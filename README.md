# Whats all this about?
These are some content pieces I am creating for practice in an AP CS class. They are a WIP and part of my volunteer work for Tealsk12. 
The actual course content is hosted at [code.org](https://studio.code.org/courses/csp-2018) and this repo supplements that
work with some exercises.

Each individual directory(see the branches from the drop down) has its own README describing the tasks to be done.

I also created media for the course that are pretty cool. Here is an example:

Let me know if you want to create more for the other projects in this repo.
